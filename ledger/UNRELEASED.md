# Unreleased changes

All notable unreleased changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

tl;dr is that for every big change, a developer add a corresponding entry into this
file (`UNRELEASED.md`). Once a release is ready, the maintainer needs to move entries
from this file into the section with the corresponding version number and release date
in `CHANGELOG.md`.

NOTE: As a convenience, you can include JIRA issue number as [jira:XXXX-YYYY], and
the release script will make a proper link to JIRA.
